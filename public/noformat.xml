    <title>No Format</title>
    <link>http://www.distantfuturejosh.com/noformat</link>
    <description>Trying to explain what this podcast is about would be like trying to teach grandma how to send an email. It seems easy enough at first but you'll soon find it an impossible task. No Format is not a nerd-cast; we're clearly two social, pleasant, good looking gentlemen (ep. 28). No Format is not a comedy-cast; we never joke about the topic at hand and take our jobs very seriously as distributors of internet content (ep. 15). No Format is not a videogame-cast; Josh has only beaten 6 out of 8 Zelda games and we rarely play videogames while podcasting (ep. 7). No Format is not a science-cast; the occasional episode on nuclear fission and mathematical proofs will appear now and then, but all together we are not great sources of information (ep. 11 &amp; 39). And lastly, No Format is by no means a film-cast; we just happen to know someone who makes movies (ep. 27). It also just happens that we have excellent taste and never come to dissagreements on movies (ep. 42). So what would one expect from a typical episode? We don't really have a format. Chances are if you have a mustache, play(ed) with Ninja Turtles, own a telescope, hate ugly fonts, have a friend from Korea, enjoy a good scotch, have a favorite dinosaur, wished you could golf better, prefer the original theatrical Star Wars, or in general read Wikipedia articles at least 3 times per day, you'll probably find what you've been looking for all along in this, the No Format podcast.</description>

      <description>You're either going to find this episode slightly entertaning or dreadfully boring depending on you're knowledge of Mushrooms, Crayons and Beatrix Potter.

      <description>Special guest Travis Hayes joins us on his crappy microphone for a riveting discussion about video games. We go all over the board so even if you've never played a single minute of Metroid we're sure to touch on a game that interests you. That being said, if you have successfully achieved shinespark (which to me sounds like you had a wet dream about Samus) you will certainly enjoy this weeks episode through and through.</description>

      <description>I started writing the summary for this episode but I couldn't think of anything so I started playing Tiny Wings. Haven't heard of it? It's the seventh best selling app on the store, and a personal favorite of the No Format podcast, and Andreas Illiger just updated it to Version 2.0 adding an extra mode of play "flight school". Anyway, this episode also contains various other topics but why don't you buy Tiny Wings, download this podcast, and nestle into your favorite chair. We'll be your background music.</description>

      <description>Gene is back from Korea and joins us once again, this time for a roundtable discussion of important stuff. So you should probably listen to it. Cause it&apos;s important. Oh, and if you haven&apos;t seen The Avengers yet, I suggest you put this episode on hold. Unless you have no interest in The Avengers. But then you might not want to listen to this episode anyway.</description>

      <description>That&apos;s right. We&apos;re talkin&apos; about bombs this episode. And not just any bombs, we&apos;re taking it straight to the top with the mother of all bombs. Who would have thought that while listening to your favorite podcast as you eat your Cheerios this morning that you would learn the delicate details of constructing your very own nuclear warhead? You didn&apos;t think this show was all about fun and games did you? Well I don&apos;t blame you because we kind of went off on a rant last episode about Zelda. Hey that&apos;s kind of a coincidence; last week we talked about the mother of all games, this week the mother of all bombs. Go figure.</description>

      <description>So this episode, being our 10th, is kind of a big deal to us. What better way to celebrate it by discussing the biggest game of console history. And I mean that. Google it. Right now. Type &quot;What is the best game ever?&quot; into the google search field and read the answer: The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time. It is such a good game we decided to invite our close friend and official Zelda expert, Toni Hansen, to join us in praising the epicness that is this legendary N64 title. Sit back, put your hookshot down and give this episode a listen. If you&apos;ve never played Zelda OoT, may this podcast press upon you the importance of experiencing such a masterpiece of a game, and urge you to drop a Benjamin or so on a Wii and download it for the price of a single Hamilton. You will not regret it.</description>

      <description>We&apos;re back on track with a very special episode of No Format! This time we invite our friend Jeremy Commandeur on the show so he can school us in some Trek facts. Sorry, we didn&apos;t announce what we were going to watch during the last episode (we forgot to do a lot of things in the last episode...) but if you&apos;d like, you could prepare yourself by watching The Best of Both Worlds, Parts 1 &amp; 2, Star Trek, The Next Generation. Leave your popped collar and chinos at home cause we nerd out pretty bad in this one. Also, remember the gravity question we asked in Episode 6? We got an answer. And you won&apos;t believe it, we made it through this episode with out having to bleep anything Jason says!</description>

      <description>I&apos;m gonna tell you right now, this was a train wreck. A conceptually good idea, gone bad. Real bad. So bad I&apos;m not going to describe what happens. Hopefully this intrigues you to listen to it, but be warned, I told you it was bad. And it&apos;s not one of those,&quot;he&apos;s telling us it&apos;s bad, but in the end, it will be so bad it&apos;s funny&quot;, sort of things. It&apos;s just an all around bad episode. The one good thing we get around to talking about is the bestest fast food restaurant in the world. Hope you enjoy. And believe me, we&apos;ll be back on track next week.</description>

      <description>Are you ready to learn about Wetenkamp family folklore, century old dead dudes, and free baby grand pianos? This week&apos;s episode discusses those topics and more. I really hope this is not your first episode of No Format, cause it&apos;s not our best. Hang in there and we&apos;ll be sure to entertain you next week as we continue to follow our motto of absolutely no ground rules. In fact, next week we will probably stake out a plot in the vast wasteland that is the iTunes directory, but for now try streaming Episode 4 right from the browser of your computer or, better yet, your mobile phone.

      <description>Listen to episode 2 of Josh and Jason&apos;s podcast, tentatively titled, &quot;No Format&quot;. It&apos;s about important stuff like endangered species and Jesus websites. So basically if you don&apos;t listen to it you hate animals, Jesus and the internet. But I think you&apos;ll find it to be a worthy background noise for your commute home assuming you don&apos;t have the new Chili Peppers album or any other slightly worthwhile album, podcast or jazz flute solo.

So basically if you don&apos;t listen to it you hate animals, Jesus and the internet. But I think you&apos;ll find it to be a worthy background noise for your commute home assuming you don&apos;t have the new Chili Peppers album or any other slightly worthwhile album, podcast or jazz flute solo. Feel free to control click (or right click) the link below and download the mp3 file so you can listen to it on your i device.</itunes:summary>
