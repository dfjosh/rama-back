	<p><span class="questions">Do you use Safari as your primary browser? Do you like seeing your bookmarks when you open a new tab? Would you prefer not seeing your most visited sites? Are you constantly thinking about Mars? Are you bored out of your mind?</span></p>
	<p>If you answered 'yes' to each of the questions above, you will most assuredly benefit from what this website has to offer. Behold, I present to you <strong>Destroy All Sites</strong>:</p>

	<p>By following the ensuing steps, you will blow up your Top Sites and replace them with sweet images of the Martian surface as photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Tired of the random images you're seeing? Refresh them at your whim. Did you make a huge mistake by destroying your Top Sites? Clear the images and return back to your boring Top Sites anytime.</p>

	</div>
	<h5>Step 2</h5>
	<p><a href="javascript:;" class="openTabs">Destroy!</a>Press the button on the right. Your browser will blow up with six new tabs. Each one will contain a sweet martian image. Let them load.</p>

	</div>
	<p>You should now be seeing some pretty sweet images every time you press cmd-T. You can thank science for that. What's that? You want to see more Red Planet? Press cmd-R to refresh them any time you want. If you get really sick of them, hover your mouse over an image to reveal the delete button. Or just add 6 different boring sites to your Top Sites.</p>
